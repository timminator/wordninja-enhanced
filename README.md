## â„¹ About

This is a fork of the popular wordninja repository and improves on it in several aspects.

The language support was extendend to the following languages out of the box:

- English (en)
- German (de)
- French (fr)
- Italian (it)
- Spanish (es)
- Portuguese (pt)

More functionalities were added aswell.
- A new rejoin() function was created. It splits merged words in a sentence and returns the whole sentence with the corrected words while retaining spacing rules for punctuation characters.
- A candidates() function was added that returns not only one result, but instead several results sorted py their cost.
- It is now possible to specify additional words that should be added to the dictionary or words that should be excluded while initializing the LanguageModel.
- Hyphenated words are now also supported.
- The algorithm now also preserves punctuation while spitting merged words and does no longer break down when encountering unknown characters.

More info about these functionalities can be found further down in the usage section. 

## How to Install

```
pip install wordninja-enhanced
```

## Usage

The functionalities are explained in the following code snippet:

```python
import wordninja_enhanced as wordninja

# This function splits merged words for you 
split_text= wordninja.split("Splitthesemergedwordsforme")
print(f"Example 1: {split_text}")

# This function gives you several candidates how the input could be split,
# sorted by the lowest cost.
# The second argument specifies the number of candidates to return
candidates_list = wordninja.candidates("derekanderson", 3)
print("Example 2:")
for i, candidate in enumerate(candidates_list):
    print(f"candidate {i+1}: {candidate}")

# This function splits merged words and returns the correctly splitted string,
# while applying correct spacing rules for punctuation characters.
rejoined_text = wordninja.rejoin("That'sthesheriff's\"badge\" youarewearing!")
print(f"Example 3: {rejoined_text}")


# Without any further arguments the default language is set to english
lm = wordninja.LanguageModel()
joined_text = lm.rejoin("Thisisanothermergedtextexample.")
print(f"Example 4: {joined_text}")

# You can use another language by specifying it via the language parameter.
lm = wordninja.LanguageModel(language='de')
joined_text = lm.rejoin("Wiegehtesdir?")
print(f"Example 5: {split_text}")

# The LanguageModel also allows you to use your own dictionary when the language
# is specfied as 'custom'. It also allows you to specify additional words that
# are maybe missing from the dictionary and it also allows you to specify words
# that should not be split via a blacklist.
# The add_to_top parameter controls if the additional words will be added
# to the top of the dictionary (more likely to be split) or to the bottom.
custom_lm = wordninja.LanguageModel(language='custom',
    word_file=r'path\to\your\custom_dict.txt.gz',
    add_words=[],
    blacklist=[],
    add_to_top=True # Default false
)
```

The output from the 5 examples is the following:
```
Example 1: ['Split', 'these', 'merged', 'words', 'for', 'me']
Example 2:
candidate 1: ['derek', 'anderson']
candidate 2: ['derek', 'anders', 'on']
candidate 3: ['derek', 'and', 'ers', 'on']
Example 3: That's the sheriff's "badge" you are wearing!
Example 4: This is another merged text example.
Example 5: Wie geht es dir?
```


It can also handle long strings:
```
>>> wordninja.split('wethepeopleoftheunitedstatesinordertoformamoreperfectunionestablishjusticeinsuredomestictranquilityprovideforthecommondefencepromotethegeneralwelfareandsecuretheblessingsoflibertytoourselvesandourposteritydoordainandestablishthisconstitutionfortheunitedstatesofamerica')
['we', 'the', 'people', 'of', 'the', 'united', 'states', 'in', 'order', 'to', 'form', 'a', 'more', 'perfect', 'union', 'establish', 'justice', 'in', 'sure', 'domestic', 'tranquility', 'provide', 'for', 'the', 'common', 'defence', 'promote', 'the', 'general', 'welfare', 'and', 'secure', 'the', 'blessings', 'of', 'liberty', 'to', 'ourselves', 'and', 'our', 'posterity', 'do', 'ordain', 'and', 'establish', 'this', 'constitution', 'for', 'the', 'united', 'states', 'of', 'america']
```

## Further notes

The files and the script to create the dictionaries are also included in the Dictionaries folder.
They can be created by just running the script 'create_dictionaries.py'.

If you are interested in adding support for another language feel free to add your language to the language_config in the script and to create a corresponding corpus folder with the language data.
